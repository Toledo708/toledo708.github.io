+How I did this page?
I did this with github pages and I will try to be active?

+Why I did this site?
Well... 
I did this site because I want to be a personal web also I want contribute
with the developers community with anythings 
For exemple:
*Python tutorial
*Say anything I'm studing
*Express some things that I think is controversial
*And other thing
+Basically, it is twitter but instead of being in
your twitter account will your opinions be on this website?
Hehe, **YEAHHH**
